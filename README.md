I'm a quick learner and collaborate closely with clients to create efficient, scalable, and user-friendly solutions that solve real-world problems. I have worked with service and product-centric organizations like Tata Consultancy Services, Vanguard, Globant, and Verificient to design, develop, improve, and migrate legacy applications using modern technology stacks. I have led teams on different fronts for technical, non-technical, and administrative tasks. Let's work together to bring your ideas to life!
